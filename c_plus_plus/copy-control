If your define the copy-construction functionï¼Œ you had better to define the
default construction function.
Actually, we should use copy constructor function and assignment operator as a
same unit. if you need one of them, you also need another one.
If you need to define the destructor, you also need to define the copy
constructor and operator. this is call the rule of three

short-circuit evaluation if not supported in operator overwrite
If you want to define the operator as non-member function, add keyword friend
for it.

If you re-define the operator as non-member function, you must add the word "friend" for it.
