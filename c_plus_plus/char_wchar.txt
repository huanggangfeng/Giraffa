char is used for so called ANSI family of functions (typically function name ends with A), 
or more commonly known as using ASCII character set.

wchar_t is used for new so called Unicode (or Wide) family of functions (typically function name ends with W), 
which use UTF-16 character set. It is very similar to UCS-2, but not quite it. If character requires more than 2 bytes,
it will be converted into 2 composite codepoints, and this can be very confusing.


WCHAR (or wchar_t on Visual C++ compiler) is used for Unicode UTF-16 strings.
This is the "native" string encoding used by Win32 APIs.

CHAR (or char) can be used for several other string formats: ANSI, MBCS, UTF-8.
