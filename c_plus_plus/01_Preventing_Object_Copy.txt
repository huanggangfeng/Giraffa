There are three ways to prevent an object copy: 
1. keeping the copy constructor and assignment operator private
2. using a special non-copyable mixin
3. deleting those special member functions(C++11)

Method 1: Private copy constructor and copy assignment operator

class Car {
public:
  Car(): owner() {}
  void setOwner(Person *o) { owner = o; }
  Person *getOwner() const { return owner; }
  void info() const;
private:
  Car(const Car&);
  Car& operator=(const Car&);
  Person *owner;
};

Method 2: Non-copyable mixin

Boost users may be already familiar with boost::noncopyable, the Boost flavor of the said mixin. A conceptual, self-contained implementation of that mixin will resemble something like the following:

Compared to the first method, using Noncopyable has the benefit of making the intention very clear. A quick glance at the class, right on its first line, and you know right away that its instance is not supposed to be copied.


Method 3: Deleted copy constructor and copy assignment operator

For modern applications, there is less and less reason to get stuck with the above workaround. Thanks to C++11, the solution becomes magically simple: just delete the copy constructor and assignment operator. Our class will look like this instead:

class Car {
public:
  Car(const Car&) = delete;
  void operator=(const Car&) = delete;
  Car(): owner() {}
  void setOwner(Person *o) { owner = o; }
  Person *getOwner() const { return owner; }
private:
  Person *owner;
};
